Audit Trail	Keep track of status transitions (e.g., a request_status_history table) — for analytics and transparency.



Notification System	What triggers notifications? Webhooks / FCM / Background job? Make sure it’s decoupled from the main flow so requests aren’t delayed.



Reassignment Logic	What if the selected maintainer becomes unavailable before starting? Consider having a fallback or a "REASSIGN" flow.


Preferred Time Handling	Does the system validate if a maintainer is available at the preferred time? That can be added later but it’s good to keep in mind.



Pictures After Completion	Do maintainers need to upload an image after completion (for evidence)? If so, allow that.


Admin View	Web portal should include filtering by building/company/date/status, etc




Ratings	Simple customer_rate is great now. In future, consider full review/comments and a separate ratings table for historical tracking.
